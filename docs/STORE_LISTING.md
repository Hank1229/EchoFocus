## Detailed Description

EchoFocus is an AI-powered productivity tracker that helps you understand how you actually spend your time online — without compromising your privacy.

**How it works**

EchoFocus runs quietly in the background as you browse. It tracks which sites you visit and for how long, categorizes them as productive, distraction, or neutral, and computes a daily Focus Score (0–100) that reflects how well you stayed on task. At the end of each day, Google Gemini AI analyzes your anonymized activity and delivers a personalized insight — what went well, what pulled your attention, and a concrete suggestion for tomorrow.

**Privacy-first architecture**

Your raw browsing data never leaves your device. Domain names, durations, and categories are stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (chrome.storage.local). The only data that ever reaches our servers is already-aggregated statistics (e.g., "3 hours on productive sites") and the AI analysis result — never URLs, page titles, or your full browsing history. You can export or permanently delete all your data at any time from the extension settings.

**Key features**

- **Focus Score** — a 0–100 daily score based on your productive vs. distraction time ratio
- **AI Daily Snapshots** — Gemini-powered personalized insights and actionable tips, generated from anonymized data
- **Daily Email Reports** — optional morning email with your previous day's score, top sites, and AI summary
- **Web Dashboard** — view trends, 7/30-day charts, and AI history at echofocus.app
- **Custom Rules** — override default category assignments for any domain to match your workflow
- **Data Export & Delete** — full control over your data, always

**Who it's for**

EchoFocus is built for developers, designers, writers, students, and anyone who wants honest visibility into their digital habits without surrendering their browsing history to a third-party cloud. If you've ever finished a workday wondering where the time went, EchoFocus gives you the answer.
